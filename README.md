The scores by school spending, by school size and school type did not change with the removal of the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School


## Summary
After removing the math and reading scores for the 9th graders in Thomas High School, the average grades for the school changed by a small amount and it changed the district summary averages by a very small amount. This change was not large enough to affect the spot of Thomas high school in the top 5 schools and it didnâ€™t change the overall scores by school size, type, or spending.
